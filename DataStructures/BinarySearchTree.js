/**
 * data points on a tree are called nodes. The node at the top of the tree is called the root node
 * Nodes with branches leading to other nodes(children) are referred to as the parent node
 * Leaf nodes are nodes at the end of the tree that have no children
 * Any children of a node are parents of their own subtree
 * 
 * In a binary search tree, each node can have at most 2 children. Other tree structures may have multiple  
 * Binary search trees are also ordered. 
 * The left node/ left subtree contains values that are less than the parent node
 * the right subtree contains values/nodes that are greater than the parent
 * the same concept applies as the tree grows and expans, left node will always be the smaller than the parent, right will always greater than the parent node
 * 
 * Note this concept of left is less and right is greater only applies to binary search trees. In a binary tree, this doesnt matter
